    <!-- What is In Bloom -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container container-narrow">
        <h2 class="mb-md">What is In Bloom?</h2>
        <p class="text-large mb-md">
          In Bloom is a conversation series that brings together curious, thoughtful people to explore 
          the complexities of modern relationships.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-md">
          We live in an era of unprecedented connection and paradoxical loneliness. Dating apps promise 
          infinite choice while making it harder to commit. We're hyper-aware of our communication patterns 
          yet still struggle to be vulnerable. Technology offers new ways to stay close, but also new ways 
          to hide.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-md">
          In Bloom creates a space to sit with these tensions—not to solve them, but to examine them together 
          with honesty, nuance, and care. Through intimate events featuring therapists, writers, researchers, 
          and cultural observers, we explore what it means to love, connect, and show up for each other in the digital age.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a networking event or a singles mixer. It's a salon, a forum, a place for reflection. 
          We believe that understanding our relationships more deeply helps us show up more fully—to partners, 
          to friends, to ourselves.
        </p>

    <!-- Why We Exist -->
    <section class="section" style="background-color: var(--color-background-alt);">
      <div class="container container-narrow">
        <h2 class="mb-md">Why we exist</h2>
        <p class="mb-md">
          Conversations about modern love often fall into two camps: overly clinical advice or dismissive 
          generalizations about "kids these days." We wanted something different.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-md">
          In Bloom was born from a belief that we need spaces that take relationships seriously—as sites of 
          growth, challenge, joy, and meaning. We need conversations that are smart without being academic, 
          personal without being prescriptive, and grounded in real experiences without flattening them into trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          We exist to help people feel less alone in their questions and more equipped to navigate the 
          beautiful, messy work of connection.

            Our events are capped at 40–50 people to foster genuine conversation. This isn't a lecture hall;
